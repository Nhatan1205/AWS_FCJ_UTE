# Scrum Events, Pillars, and Values

---

## 1. Scrum Events

Scrum defines five key events that support **transparency**, **inspection**, and **adaptation**. These events occur within each Sprint.

### Sprint
- A Sprint is a fixed-length timebox (typically 1 to 4 weeks) during which a usable and potentially releasable product Increment is created.
- The next Sprint starts immediately after the previous one ends.
- It includes all other Scrum events.
- Each Sprint has a clearly defined Sprint Goal.

### Sprint Planning
- Occurs at the beginning of each Sprint.
- The Scrum Team decides what will be delivered and how the work will be done.
- It answers three key questions:
  1. Why is this Sprint valuable? (Sprint Goal)
  2. What can be done during the Sprint?
  3. How will the chosen work get done?

### Daily Scrum
- A 15-minute event held daily for Developers.
- Used to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adjust plans accordingly.
- Focuses on team synchronization and identifying obstacles.
- Scrum Master and Product Owner may attend, but only Developers are required.

### Sprint Review
- Held at the end of the Sprint.
- The Scrum Team presents the Increment to stakeholders for feedback.
- The Product Backlog may be updated based on the feedback received.
- Encourages transparency and shared understanding of progress.

### Sprint Retrospective
- Takes place after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning.
- The team reflects on the Sprint in terms of:
  - Individuals
  - Interactions
  - Processes
  - Tools
- The goal is to identify improvements for the next Sprint.
- Promotes continuous improvement.

## 2. Scrum Pillars

Scrum is built on three foundational pillars:

### Transparency
- All aspects of the Scrum process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
- Requires:
  - A common language
  - Shared definitions
  - Clear visibility of key elements
- Examples: Making the Product Backlog and Sprint Goal visible to everyone.

### Inspection
- Scrum artifacts and progress must be inspected frequently to detect unwanted deviations.
- Inspection happens during all Scrum events.
- Helps the team identify and address issues early.

### Adaptation
- When a process or product deviates outside acceptable limits, adjustments must be made immediately.
- Ensures the team continuously improves.
- Helps keep the product and process on the right track.

## 3. Scrum Values

Scrum is guided by five core values that influence team behavior and decision-making:

### Commitment
- Team members personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.

### Focus
- Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the team.

### Openness
- The team and stakeholders are open about work and challenges.

### Respect
- Team members respect each otherâ€™s skills, experiences, and contributions.

### Courage
- The team has the courage to do the right thing, face challenges, and make necessary changes.
