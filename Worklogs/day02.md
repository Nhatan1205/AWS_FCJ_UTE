# Continue learning basic knowledge about AWS. 

## 1. Optimize costs and work on AWS Support
### 1.1. Optimize costs.
+ Choose suitable configuration and data location.
+ Take advantage of discount payment like **reserved instance**, **saving plan** and **spot**
+ Delete resouces that we didnt use anymore or just turn on resources when we use (avoid running 24/7).
+ Take advantage of **serverless** service.
+ **Design effective architecture** to meet requirements.
+ Install and use `AWS Budget`. Eg: when we use every 10 dollars, notifying(warning) us or we can write script to request on turning off server when it runs over 10 dollars.
+ Manage expenses by department/ apply `cost allocation tag`. Allocate resouces to exactly individual => analyze data monthly.
+ Continuos monitoring and optimize costs.

### 1.2 Calculate expenses.
Link: `https://calculator.aws/#/`
+ Allow to estimate common services.
+ Share estimates to others.
+ Cost are different in each region.

## 2. AWS support.
There are 4 main support packages:
+ Basic (explore)
+ Developer (Test/ dev)
+ Business (Production)
+ Enterprise (Large enterprise).
  
In some cases, we can upgrade our package in short term to request more support (not recommended).

## 3. Intro to practise
